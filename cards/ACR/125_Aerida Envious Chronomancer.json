The one that came along one in a century, if not longer, as the academic elite were prone to telling her. Not to mention that her planeswalker status gave her a vaulted position in a world obsessed with learning more about how planes work. During her youth, she became close friends with another planeswalker: Felice. A walker from another plane who was just as much a prodigy as Aerida. And over time, that began to chaff on Aerida; the idea that she wasn't as special as she had thought. Jealousy began to grow, and truly flared when Felice discovered a method of achieving immortality, refused to share the secret, and then left. Aerida followed, after discovering a way to manipulate time to similarly drastically expand her lifespan, and in her jealousy orchestrated a plot that resulted in the death of Felice; effectively dooming the entire plane of Adira in the process.\n\nDesign Philosophy: Aerida is a creature of ego and intellect. To simply win is not enough; her victory must demonstrate her raw superiority. Her abilities should reflect this through abilities that require build-around and/orplay-around, and should also feel like a self-contained combo card."}
