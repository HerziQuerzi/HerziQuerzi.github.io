During a riot, Salva was trapped inside a burning building, igniting their spark.\nNow, whenever they return to Festenya, they are caught in the uncomfortable position of being allowed to move amongst the higher echelons of society due to their spark while still being isolated and scorned for their local elvish blood.\nIs currently on Arcanum to make use of their vast knowledge on magic as part of their continuining attempts to extend their elvish lifespan to put them on par with Festenya humans, if not more.\n\nDesign Philosophy: Since their bio is based upon feeling resentful towards the privilege and power humans have over elves on Festenya, their abilities should focus around the idea of taking from others to bolster themself. Alternatively, punishing others for their greed/affluence."}
