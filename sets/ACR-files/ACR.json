Born on the plane of Arcanum, he still lives there with his mother.\nHis parents have been seperated for several years now, due to the inherent tension between his father's desire to live a quiet life in the country and his mother's need for the hustle and bustle of the Arpechian Academy. While Ardy stayed with his mother, he still regularly visits his father.\nHis spark was ignited when he was fourteen, waking one night to the smell of smoke. By the time he realized what was happening and had woken his mother, the fire had trapped them. His sparks ignition whisked him away before the fire could reach him; and while his mother received burns severe enough to cause her to lose her arm (which she has since had a artificial replacement made for), she also managed to escape the fire via more mundane means.\nWorried about the dangers the Multiverse could hold for someone so young, Ardy's mother enlisted the help of another planeswalker who worked as a professor at the Arpechian Academy: Rahit. She convinced Ardy not to 'walk without Rahit's oversight, though as he's gotten older, he's been sneaking off on solo 'walks more and more. Meanwhile, his mother and Rahit have been growing closer, and recently Rahit has moved in with them.\n\nDesign Philosophy: As a bright and cheerful character, Ardy\u2019s abilities should not be overly aggressive in nature. No burn, no fight, very limited destroy effects (if any). The abilities should also feel loose and full of potential, to reflect Ardy\u2019s creative mindset.\nWith this particular card, the ult is about as aggressive as I\u2019d be willing to go. Perhaps even too aggressive, but it does a good job of capturing Ardy\u2019s occasional over-the-top showing off."

In an attempt to save it, Felice went to the plane of Arcanum to study to try and find a way to fix it. Eventually she found something that might work - a method for immortality that she hoped to apply on a much larger scale - and went back to Adira. The solution was the pump the plane with so much stabilizing white mana that it stopped collapsing, and had the side effect of all but removing death from the plane. But it was a brittle fix, and as the strain on the fix increased so did the amount of mana necessary, until eventually even time on Adira (compared to the rest of the multiverse) slowed down. And so over the course of two centuries years normal time, Felice herself experience several thousand years, albeit in a fugue state. When Aerida supposedly killed Felice, the spell/fix broke, and all that pent up strain started tearing Adira apart faster than ever. Felice, however, survived, and after recovering, sought out Arcanum once more in search for another way to save her plane.\n\nDesign Philosophy: Much of Felice\u2019s powers and ideals revolve around the idea of stabilization. In addition, a major theme of cheating death and immortality. Permanent reanimation is one of her hallmarks, in addition to general control elements."

The one that came along one in a century, if not longer, as the academic elite were prone to telling her. Not to mention that her planeswalker status gave her a vaulted position in a world obsessed with learning more about how planes work. During her youth, she became close friends with another planeswalker: Felice. A walker from another plane who was just as much a prodigy as Aerida. And over time, that began to chaff on Aerida; the idea that she wasn't as special as she had thought. Jealousy began to grow, and truly flared when Felice discovered a method of achieving immortality, refused to share the secret, and then left. Aerida followed, after discovering a way to manipulate time to similarly drastically expand her lifespan, and in her jealousy orchestrated a plot that resulted in the death of Felice; effectively dooming the entire plane of Adira in the process.\n\nDesign Philosophy: Aerida is a creature of ego and intellect. To simply win is not enough; her victory must demonstrate her raw superiority. Her abilities should reflect this through abilities that require build-around and/orplay-around, and should also feel like a self-contained combo card."
